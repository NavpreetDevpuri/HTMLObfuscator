        <p>Look into devTools. It is magical how some invisible zero-width characters can change the text for a computer or bot but, it looks same for human eys! </p>
        <p>This Python script can insert those zero-width characters randomly into HTML content according to given probability that means each character in HTML content will have an extra zero-width character with given probability. For example if probability is 0.5 then half of the HTML content is going to be zero-width characters.</p>
        <p>This Python script also inserts some random span tags with some random sentences according to given probability and word count.</p>
        <p>This Python script also hides some content into html attribute and CSS inserts it using ::after according to given probability.</p>
		<p>Example: python main.py -i .\example.html -o .\example_obfuscated.html</p>
